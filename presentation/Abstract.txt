This talk is dedicated to the concept of hash tables. After a small
introduction about databases and their uses of hash tables, we focus on an
early example of a disk-stored hash table devised by Ken Thompson for
UNIXv7. We discuss its limitations and how the concept can be reused as one
of the building block of modern databases.
